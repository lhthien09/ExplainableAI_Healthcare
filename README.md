_Github for Topic of prioritizing end-stage patients awaiting for transplantation_

## Overview

In the scope of the course Machine Learning Workshop, we would like to perform the analysis and
investigate the possibility of using ML models in the feld of medicine. In detailed, the States currently
adopts Sickest-First Policy, which means for the patients having end-stage disease (e.g: end-stage liver
disease) and requiring transplantation a new organ, there is a formula used to assess the severity of
patients, afterwards, place them on the waiting list. The sicker the patient is, the higher place he/she is
on the waiting list, and when compatible donated organs from deceased donors, sooner that patient will
get transplanted.
In our study, we will place our emphasis for liver transplant. To assess the severity of end-stage liver
patients, physicians in the US are using MELD-Score formula:
